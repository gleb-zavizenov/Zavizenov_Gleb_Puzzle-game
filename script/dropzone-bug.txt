Problem:
User can add several images to one drop zone.
Images overlap each other and become undragable.

Solution:
We need to check whether a drop zone already has a child before adding a child to it on drag.

Pathway:
1) Go to the "zone.addEventListener("drop", function(e){})" function
2) Use "zone.children.length" to check if a zone has a child
3) "e.target.appendChild(document.querySelector(`#${draggedElement}`));" if the condition is true
4) "console.log("Zone already has an element");" if the condition is false
